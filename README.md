# Sudoku
Hey! welcome to my sudoku project.
The project written in C language.
The game session should played half by user - half by computer.
Instead of the game flow anf functionallity, you can be impressed from using of linked lists, binary trees, and other familiar data structers.
Enjoy :)
Amir.
