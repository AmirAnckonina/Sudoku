## General Info
Welcome to my Sudoku project.

The project written in C language.

Instead of building flowed and functional game, the main goal of the project is to implement the use of pointers and data structures such as linked lists, binary trees, arrayes, etc.

Enjoy :)

## Technologies
- C++ Programming language 
- Visual Studio 2019 on Windows 10

## Rules
This program will run a classic soduko game for X players.

Each game played "half by user" and "half by computer".

try to insert numbers to cells in order to fill the board, with considering the following rules:

Every square has to contain a single number

Only the numbers from 1 through to 9 can be used

Each 3Ã—3 box can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once

Each vertical column can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once

Each horizontal row can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once

Enjoy!
