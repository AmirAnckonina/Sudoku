# Sudoku

Welcome to my Sudoku project.

The project written in C language.

The game session should played half by user - half by computer.

Instead of building flowed and functional game, the main goal of the project is to implement the use of pointers and data structers such as linked lists, binary trees, arrayes, etc.

Enjoy :)

Amir.
