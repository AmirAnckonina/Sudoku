
//Welcome to soduko project.
//This program will run a classic soduko game for X players.
//Each game played "half by user" and "half by computer".
//try to insert numbers to cells in order to fill the board, with considering the following rules:
// *Every square has to contain a single number
// *Only the numbers from 1 through to 9 can be used
// *Each 3Ã—3 box can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
// *Each vertical column can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
// *Each horizontal row can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
//Enjoy!
